**The sense that your soul is eternal makes you cowardly, because failure would stick with you forever.**

## Who am I?
Hi. I'm twenty years old ISTP guy, previously working as backend developer. now I'm looking for new opportunity.  
My favourite language is [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust), [Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript).  

I start to learn programming since [2018](https://github.com/Wireless4024?tab=overview&from=2018-12-01&to=2018-12-31#user-activity-overview), 
my first programming language is java.  
Mostly my programming experiences came from trial and error and googling.     
I spend about [14 hours per week](https://wakatime.com/@wireless4024) in coding, mostly just to ensure my knowledge don't want to leave my brain cells.
